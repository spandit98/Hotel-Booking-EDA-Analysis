# Introduction
Hotel and hospitality business has been an exceedingly lucrative medium for quite a few generations now. Startups are coming up with unique ideas to enter the market and exponentiate their business in a short time. Well, there are even old players on the field who anyway would try to stay relevant for as long as possible, amongst these new business owners. So, to match up to the competition, the startups would look for the most welcoming business in the relative market. One such startup wants to look for the most profitable line in the market, for which it has been given the data set of each from two kinds of hotels, Resort hotel and City hotel. This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data. Our motive will be to analyse the data and suggest them the factors which determine their growth rate in the market.
